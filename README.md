where you want to add the title of disease name in the service section's boxes...... add it in the place of numbers from 1 to 24 in the code of service section itself .
example : 
original - <div class="service-box">
                <h3>ONE</h3>
                <a href="ONE.HTML" class="click-button">READ MORE</a>
            </div>
Edited - <div class="service-box">
                <h3> LUKEMIA </h3>
                <a href="ONE.HTML" class="click-button">READ MORE</a>
            </div>
Now you have edited it and added the name of disease on the service page now you have to change the content of that disease, it has separate dedicated webpage for each 24 diseases .
next step : If you have given name LUKEMIA for first box then you have to add the content of LUKEMIA on the same href file attached to that LUKEMIA , like in above example LUKEMIA is given to ONE.html box so you have to add the content of LUKEMIA to ONE.html file in the project. 

Do this above for all the 24 boxes and if you want to add additional boxes in the webpage just copy this : <div class="service-box">
                <h3>ONE</h3>
                <a href="ONE.HTML" class="click-button">READ MORE</a>
            </div>
and paste it above the line <!-- add more boxes as needed --> and change the content accordingly and if you have added any additional box then create a separate html file for that box like TWENTYFIVE.html (additional 25th box ) in the project.

just do this changes and your project will be ready .
